in this folder we are going to write the code in industry standards.
we are going to make the entire program in to three files.
1) 2048.h // header file
2) 2048.cpp //worker file
3) main.cpp //the file that contains main() function.

this will enhance the modularity and redability of the code.
this will amke the program future proof.

NOTE : to run the code of modular file, we need to compile 
        the both 2048game.cpp and main.cpp at a time.
        use the following command.
        {g++ main.cpp game2048.cpp -o main}
